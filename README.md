# Overview

* This is my Kotlin program which is a "Higher-Lower" game in which the player must guess between 1 and 100 until they correctly guess the computer's random number. 

* The purpose of completing this project was to learn Kotlin and understand how it works and get better at using it to create simple projects just like this one.

* This program uses many Kotlin functionalities such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.

# Video Demonstration

* This is a brief video that I recorded which shows how to use the program and how it works behind the scenes in terms of the code and structure.

# Development Environment

* The tool that I used to develop the software was a website called [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~). This is a new IDE that I used to create this project and I loved working with it. It works just like any desktop based IDE and has a lot of the same functionality so it was a very fun experience and I would make future projects on this website.
* The programming language that I used to complete this project is Kotlin. It is a very interesting and unique language which is based around object oriented programming and I enjoyed using it very much. Kotlin is also a statically typed programming language interoperable with Java and Android which also makes it useful and interesting.
* Github is the online repository I used to store this project.

# Useful Websites

These are some of the websites that were useful to me in making this project:
* [W3 Schools Kotlin Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/index.php) - this is the tutorial which helped me learn how to write the code and the basic structures
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is what helped me solve weird problems and do something that wasn't explained in the tutorial
* [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) - this helped me learn how to advanced things that the w3schools tutorial didn't go over
* [Official Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
* Some of the sources I used have also been linked at the bottom of the main.kt file.
